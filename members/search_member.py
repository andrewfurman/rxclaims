# the search_member function will take in a string and return a JSON list of possible member matches for that member. The string could be the members first name the member's last name or the members first name and last name a.k.a. their full name or it could be their member ID or it could be their date of birth, or it could be their group number, or it could be their ZIP Code or city or address that they live in. Can you have this function taken in the string and then search all of those fields on the member table and then return a Jason result with possible matches?
